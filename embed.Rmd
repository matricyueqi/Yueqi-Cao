```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Here is an example of embedding a web page. In this case it is a Tableau workbook. You may want to adjust the width and height. This will work but will not be visible until you view it in a browser (and may take some time to load).

When embedding Tableau you may want to play with the size of the workbook itself. Review knitr options. For ebooks with bookdown see [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/web-pages-and-shiny-apps.html)
