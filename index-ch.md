Welcome to my homepage!

Currently Iâ€™m a master candidate in mathematics at Beijing Institute of Technology. My advisor is Prof. [Huafei Sun](https://math.bit.edu.cn/szdw/azcpl/js/shf/index.htm). My research focuses on the construction of the second fundamental form estimator on Euclidean submanifolds. A recent work can be found on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10725).
