I’m now a PhD student in statistics at Imperial College London under the supervision of Dr. [Anthea Monod](https://sites.google.com/view/antheamonod/home). My current research focuses on applying subsampling methods to topological data analysis.

I obtained my master and bachelor's degree at Beijing Institute of Technology under the supervision of Dr. [Huafei Sun](https://math.bit.edu.cn/szdw/azcpl/js/shf/index.htm). My master thesis is about the construction of the second fundamental form estimator on Euclidean submanifolds.
