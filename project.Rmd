RStudio keeps files together using projects. When you open RStudio look for the Blue R icon in the top right and then choose New Project. It looks like this. 

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/create_project.png")
```

Generally you will want to create a new project such as `my_website` in an empty directory and find an appropriate place for it.
